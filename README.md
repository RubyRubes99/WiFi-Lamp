# WiFi-Lamp
This code is written for an ESP8266 module using the Arduino framework. It enables the ESP8266 to control a lamp via a relay module. The system works by waiting for the user to press a button in an Android app, which silently triggers a specific URL in the background. When the ESP8266 receives this URL request, it sends a signal to the relay module, turning the lamp on.
